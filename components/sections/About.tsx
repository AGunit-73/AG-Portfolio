        I think in products, not tickets. I scope for impact, communicate trade-offs early,
        and instrument what I ship. My toolkit spans Python backends, React/Next.js frontends,
        cloud-native delivery, and applied AI from agentic flows and RAG to fine tuning used
        only when it beats simpler options. I work in Agile/XP rhythms and keep a crisp line to stakeholders.
